# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note: Please ensure that your node version is above 10.

## Where to start

1. Download or clone this repository. 
2. Open this project using terminal
3. Type 'yarn install' or 'npm install' in a terminal
   Now Let's wait for a system to install all the npm packages.
4. After completed, run 'yarn start'

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn build` fails to minify

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)

### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution? 
After working in Angular, jQuery, Backbone.js and React, I find more interest in React framework. It's much cleaner and easy to maintain when you write react components. There are other more benefits from React framework that I enjoy them.

Architectural design is quite important. It helps you to maintain your code. I have been a big fan of SMACSS architecture. It has helped me a lot to write re-usable and structural code. So I always tend to follow their rules. Atomic Design and Domain Driven Design are other two patterns that I follow in my code. 

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
I could have work on responsive design covering all the media query such as mobile/tablets landscape and portrait. I could have work on lazy loading, cumulative layout shift and UI testing.

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
If I had more time and need to make improvement, the first thing I would implement is Next js. React framework renders on clint side. Google claims that client side application often struggle with SEO and they tend to rank poorly. In this case, Next js comes in rescue to handle these scenario. There are lots of benefits from next js that could help to improve website performance and many more. The other updates I would improve is lazy loading images, work on Cumulative Layout Shift, work on storybook and implement Redux to manage the global state.

### Other Notes
Please send through any other code or projects that you're proud of and would like to share with us.

1. I spent many hours building a pattern-library. This has covered style guide, architecture, reusable components, scss/js naming convention and some UI examples.

2. I built a Casebuilder automation tool using laravel, mysql, react js and photoshop scripting.

3. I built a booking tool for InStitchu where customers can make an appointment for consulting their weddings, order pick ups and taking measurments.

### Quick Notes
I have created this application using create react app. Just to make a program running smoothly, I have keep a default dependencies. Here are the additional dependencies that I have included. 
i.   axios
ii.  babel-plugin-macros
iii. react-router-dom
iv.  styled-components
